I am a **Ph.D. student** at the *University of Naples Federico II (UniNA)*, Department of Agricultural Sciences, Italy.  
My research focuses on characterising the microbiome of fermented foods and exploring its impact on human health, particularly within the framework of the **fermented foods–gut–brain axis**. I employ **shotgun metagenomics** and **machine learning** methodologies to delve into these complex interactions.

In addition to my primary research, I am involved in **multi-omic projects** that integrate microbiome data with **volatilomic** and **metaproteomic** analyses. These interdisciplinary approaches aim to deepen our understanding of the microbial ecology inherent in fermented foods.

Currently, I am undertaking a **research period abroad** at the *Teagasc Food Research Centre*, Moorepark, Fermoy, Ireland. This centre is renowned for its expertise in dairy research and food for health, providing a stimulating environment for advancing my studies.

Parallel to my research activities, I serve as an **academic tutor** at the *Penitentiary University Pole*, contributing to educational initiatives within the correctional system.

Throughout my academic journey, I have gained experience with **open-source computational tools**, including **SHELL/Bash** and **R**, which are integral to my data analysis processes.

During my M.Sc. in *Agri-Environmental and Food Biotechnologies* at UniNA, I completed traineeships in **bioinformatics** at *Genomix4Life* and in **plant genomics** at UniNA.  
Prior to this, I earned a B.Sc. in *Agri-Environmental and Forestry Sciences* from UniNA.
