The Mozzarella di Bufala Campana PDO Case of Study investigates the use of explainable artificial intelligence for identifying food origin :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
The study is published in *Frontiers in Microbiology* on 03 June 2024 (eCollection 1393243) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  
Magarelli et al. employed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of cheese microbiota to generate the dataset :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  
They compared three supervised machine learning algorithms: XGBoost, Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptron :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  
Random Forest achieved the best performance with an AUC of 0.93 ± 0.10 :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.  
Random Forest also reached the highest classification accuracy of 0.87 ± 0.11 :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.  
Explainable AI methods were implemented using SHAP values for feature importance :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.  
Key microbial taxa such as *Streptococcus thermophilus* and *Lactobacillus helveticus* were identified as major contributors to the classification decision :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.  
This approach enhances the transparency and trustworthiness of AI-driven food authentication systems :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.  
The DOI for this study is 10.3389/fmicb.2024.1393243 :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.
