Fermented foods (FFs) are part of the cultural heritage of several populations, with production dating back over 8000 years.  
Over the last ~150 years, the microbial consortia of many widespread FFs have been characterised, leading in some cases to production standardisation.  
Nevertheless, limited knowledge exists about the microbial communities of local and traditional FFs and their potential effects on human health.  
Recent findings suggest that traditional FFs might be a valuable source of novel probiotic strains, enriched in nutrients and highly sustainable for the environment.  

Despite an increasing number of observational studies and randomised controlled trials, it remains unclear whether and how regular FF consumption is linked with health outcomes and enrichment of the gut microbiome in health-associated species.  
This review aims to summarise current knowledge about traditional FFs and their associated microbiomes, outlining the role of fermentation in boosting nutritional profiles and exploring potential links between FF consumption and health-beneficial outcomes.
