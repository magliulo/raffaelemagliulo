Water Buffalo Mozzarella (BM) is a typical cheese from Southern Italy with a unique flavor profile and texture, produced via traditional back-slopping and bearing a PDO label.  
To elucidate links between geographic origin, microbiome composition, and flavor development, 57 PDO BM samples were collected from dairies in Caserta (n = 35) and Salerno (n = 22).  
High-throughput shotgun metagenomic sequencing and GC-MS analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) revealed that *Streptococcus thermophilus*, *Lactobacillus helveticus*, and *Lactobacillus delbrueckii* subsp. *delbrueckii* form the core microbiome across all samples.  
Despite this common core, microbiome taxonomic profiles and VOC signatures clustered by production area, with Caserta cheeses exhibiting greater microbial diversity and distinct VOC patterns compared to Salerno counterparts.  
These findings suggest that the microbiome and its metabolic activity contribute to the “microbial terroir” shaping BM’s sensory attributes, offering novel insights for improving traceability and fraud protection of traditional PDO products.
